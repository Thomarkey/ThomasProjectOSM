This is a personal automating project based on our test framework.
Consist of Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG and Gherkin.

I automated a frequent pipeline for a web-based game named Online Soccer Manager.
It may be considered cheating but this is for learning purpose only.

These pipelines include:

- login
- crawl team to gather data
- decide who to sell based on this data and calculations
- crawl transferlist to gather data from players on it
- decide who to buy based on this data and calculations
- understanding when and who to sell/buy based on gathered data and calculations
- gathering free coins when available
